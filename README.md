# events-aggregator-app
This is the frontend of a full stack application that aggregates city events in the city of Barcelona. 
For this React app to function properly you need at least an instance of a [events-aggregator-api](https://github.com/jlgamez/events-aggregator-api) server running.
And to complement it, it would be interesting to use the python [webarcelona.net-scraper](https://github.com/jlgamez/webarcelona-scraper) to bring more data from the web. You can schedule this service using something like [crontab](https://betterprogramming.pub/https-medium-com-ratik96-scheduling-jobs-with-crontab-on-macos-add5a8b26c30)(for unix systems).
 
## Prerequisites
* Node v16.14.2
* npm v8.5.0

## Usage
* In the project root run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run `npm start` to start the app.
